AI - Driven Satellite Health Monitering System 

A real-time AI-driven satellite health and safety platform that monitors telemetry, predicts anomalies, tracks orbits, and detects debris threats using live data. Built for SkyHack, with a patent filed and future plans to collaborate with ISRO.

Overview

Modern satellites face increasing risks from debris, harsh radiation, and communication failures.
This system provides a unified dashboard that delivers:
-Real-time satellite telemetry
-Orbit position and motion tracking
-AI-powered anomaly detection
-Live debris collision alerts (LeoLabs data)
-Subsystem health diagnostics
-Telemetry simulation for testing

Key Features

Real-Time Telemetry
Track temperature, battery voltage, solar power, radiation, communication status, and subsystem performance.

Live Orbit Tracking
Visualize latitude, longitude, altitude, velocity, and satellite trajectory.

AI Anomaly Detection
Predicts issues such as:
-Battery degradation
-Thermal fluctuations
-Radiation spikes
-Communication drop-outs

Debris Collision Alerts
Uses real debris data to forecast threats and avoid potential collisions.

Telemetry Simulator
Upload telemetry files (CSV) to analyze orbit, orientation, and detect anomalies.

Documentation
Includes:
-Operational & safety protocols
-Data confidentiality guidelines
-Technical architecture and subsystem reports

Patent Status
A patent has been filed for the AI architecture and autonomous satellite health management framework developed in this project.
